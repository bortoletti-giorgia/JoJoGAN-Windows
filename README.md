# Windows Installation Tutorial
**(The JoJoGAN code will not be updated)**

Small fixes compared to [JoJoGAN-Training-Windows](https://github.com/bycloudai/JoJoGAN-Training-Windows).

Using [JoJoGAN-Training-Windows](https://github.com/bycloudai/JoJoGAN-Training-Windows) guide on NVIDIA RTX 2060 after running 
```conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch```, it was installed  ```pytorch from pytorch/win-64::pytorch-1.13.1-py3.7_cpu_0```.
In this way, CUDA was not found and Pytorch was executed with CPU so I found the combination of Python packages versions which is in the next section.

#### Step 0
On Windows 11 install:
* [Anaconda3 2022](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
* [CUDA 10.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.2-download-archive)
* Visual Studio Community 2019
* NVIDIA RTX 2060

Environment Variables should be:
```
CUDA_PATH = C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.2
Path = C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.2\bin
      C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.2\libnvvp
      C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat
      C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.29.30133\bin\Hostx64\x64
      C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.29.30133\bin
```

### Step 1
Create a new Anaconda environment.

```sh
conda create -n jojo python=3.7
conda activate jojo
```

### Step 2
Install Pytorch related.
```sh
conda install pytorch==1.10.1 torchvision==0.11.2 torchaudio==0.10.1 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
```

If install Pytorch with Pip as:
```sh
pip install torch==1.10.1+cu102 torchvision==0.11.2+cu102 torchaudio==0.10.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu102/torch_stable.html
```
you could have this error:
```sh
import dlib
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
```

### Step 3
Install Python requirement packages.
```sh
pip install tqdm gdown scikit-learn==0.22 scipy lpips dlib==19.20 opencv-python wandb matplotlib scikit-image pybind11 cmake ninja
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```

### Step 4
Clone the JoJoGAN project.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mchong6/JoJoGAN.git
cd JoJoGAN
```

### Final Test 

```sh
(jojo) C:\JoJoGAN>python
Python 3.7.16 (default, Jan 17 2023, 16:06:28) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import dlib
>>> import torch
>>> torch.cuda.is_available()
True
>>>
```

Import some JoJoGAN specific packages without errors.
```sh
(jojo) C:\JoJoGAN>python
Python 3.7.16 (default, Jan 17 2023, 16:06:28) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from model import *
>>> from e4e_projection import projection as e4e_projection
>>> from util import *
>>>
```

If there is an error than contains ```torch\utils\cpp_extension.py:237: userwarning: error checking compiler version for cl```, make sure that the Path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.29.30133\bin\Hostx64\x64" includes a "cl.exe" file otherwise search in the folder "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.29.30133\bin" for the right one.

This is the PyTorch implementation of [JoJoGAN: One Shot Face Stylization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11641).


>**Abstract:**<br>
While there have been recent advances in few-shot image stylization, these methods fail to capture stylistic details
that are obvious to humans. Details such as the shape of the eyes, the boldness of the lines, are especially difficult
for a model to learn, especially so under a limited data setting. In this work, we aim to perform one-shot image stylization that gets the details right. Given
a reference style image, we approximate paired real data using GAN inversion and finetune a pretrained StyleGAN using
that approximate paired data. We then encourage the StyleGAN to generalize so that the learned style can be applied
to all other images.
